# ODM

## Introduction

The purpose of this module is to do provide easy access to the database with the python object feature with MongoDB and pymongo. With pymongo that was very easy to make spelling mistakes of a collection name when you are doing database operation. This module provides you minimal ODM with a modeling feature so that you don’t have to look up the MongoDB dashboard(Mongo Compass) to know about field names or data types.

This module does not compromise performance since it’s not serializing a list of objects.
